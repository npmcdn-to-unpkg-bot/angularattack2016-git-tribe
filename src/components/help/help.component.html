Git Tribes is a new data visuamization concept, it's main purpose is to make the complex and boaring daskboards/interfaces more fun, by converting them to a game like ones. Our goal is to make people happy when they work, and in order to impact the game/dashboard do more work, hence improving their productivity (some sort of gamification as well).
